-- there was a case in QD-QEs distributed deployment that some QEs could skip full index scan and
-- stop updating statistics, result in QD being unable to collect all QEs' stats thus overwrote
-- a paritial accumulated value to index->reltuples. More interesting, it usually happened starting
-- from the 3rd time of consecutively VACUUM after fresh inserts due to above skipping index scan
-- criteria.
